# X-Company-Selling-Performance
This is a challenge for me to make some analysis from CSV document regarding X Company. I do some cleaning, and some insight findings

X Company want to know some insights regarding their sales performance.
As a Data Analyst, I need to go through the data, and find some clues.

The first step is Cleaning, there are some null values there, I used two approaches. Delete rows and fill it with zero 
I did some exploration and found some things:

1) All customer came from Hong Kong didn't have Customer ID (Didn't know the cause, but must be inspected further)
2) Many staffs had wrong data entry (for instance, a customer just want to order 3 pcs, but instead, we found 1000 items. To cover this, they make discount on 997 items)
3) These staffs need to be trained to not make some mistakes, or the system can be improved in the future to make some corrections.
4) The sales per month performance increased positively (the growth are more than 50%)
5) The items sold per month performance increased positively (the growth are more than 50%)
6) The most item sold are Light, Red Retrospot, Bags, Metal Sign, and Water Bottle
